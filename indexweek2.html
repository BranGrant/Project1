<h2>Things To Do</h2>

<p>All the beaches in Jamaica or tropical are similar to other Caribbean places, a fun time for the family and even by yourself or with your pets. These beaches have everything you want in a beach from Island foods such as some salmon, shrimp, etc. if you are a type of person that wants to tan you can always find a bench and get your tan on. If you are a type of person like me you could go straight to the beach waters that are usually warm. The weather in all Jamaica makes it available for a beach trip almost any day that is not raining.  </p>


<p>The waterfalls in Jamaica are beautiful and are open to the public with supervisors that make sure the well and safety of anybody who goes there. These waterfalls are high and usually have pathways to where tourist can walk and enjoy the nice view and water. Every time I go to Jamaica this is a place that I would recommend going to and I personally have experience you have plenty of fun going there such as in many other tourist. </p>
