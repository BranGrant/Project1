<p><i>Ocho Rios Jamaica</i> located near the beaches of Jamaica most popular beach. In this area you can find numerous places to enjoy yourself such as hotels with great service, many options of foods from seafood to chicken to pasta. There beautiful view of the beach and of course the beach itself. </p>

<p>
From personal experience of going there I'd completely love how the hotel looked and the vibe of everybody that worked there was very high which will also put you in a good mood and environment. I would recommend going to this place because of the hospitality and what the place can offer.
</p>
<p>
This popular area also has many different stores on the strip behind the hotel roads. Many stores you can buy souvenirs from cups to T-shirts. You can also buy street food from food vendors that sell food such as a jerk chicken and barbecue chicken that is smoked grilled by wood burned. I can personally tell you that this place is a great place to visit if you are a food lover and a beach lover and just want to enjoy yourself and relax.
